    <br> This is a selection of the custom controllers I have made for playing games. Usually I take something not designed for digital interfacing and consider the implications of
         its affordances for playful interaction.

         I use common hobby electronic platforms for my work, such as Arduino. Lately I have moved over to having the Raspberry Pi Pico as my platform of choice because of its samller form factor and lower price.

        My most common method of setting up these devices is to have them emulate a keyboard, this means they are plug and play over USB into practically any system.
